		<h1>Lab 11 Libraries & Intro to jQuery</h1>
			<div>
				<p>In this lab we are introduced of using JS Libraries and jQuery into
				our JS Source Codes. JS Libraries are JS files that can be included
				within our documents as sources such as jQuery as it is one of the
				prominent JS Libraries as to includes a plethora of small and fast
				features. When applying into our JS Source code, there are different
				convention methods as to use jQuery for us to manipulate the html
				Source Code.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>It took me some time to understand how jQuery works as to apply my
				code onto this lab page. Much of applying this in Javascript editing
				eliminates the need of document.get and replaces with $("#element")
				with easier convenience. Though this lab required me to look back at
				my previous works as to meet with lab objectives and make a button go
				green. So it was a moderately challenging lab to engage in.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>I've been able to code in a button via JQuery and made it clickable
				to pop up a message and turn the text green afterwards</p>

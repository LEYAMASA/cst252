		<h1>Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The main challenge of this lab is creating anonymous functions and
				callbacks within Javascript as the former are functions without an
				identifier that can be used for defining callbacks which are Functions
				that passes down to another function as  a parameter. Callbacks execute
				passed down functions. Example Wait 5 seconds and the function
				with the console.log activates.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>I had no problem in understanding anonymous functions and callbacks as
				I followed along the lecture inputting console commands of creating
				arrays and functions that uses an order sequence of commands. thead
				anonymous function of function(n) allowed the array I've made to be
				recognized.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Results given are that of the JS code working properly. The anonymous
				function in the JS Code works properly to sync with the simple array
				list that I've made as it added 5 to each number I've assigned onto
				the 1 to 5 array I made.</p>

		<h1>Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The main challennge of this lab is creating anonymous functions and
				callbacks within Javasscript as the former are functions without an
				identifier that can be used for defining callbacks which are Functions
				that passes down to another function as  a parameter. Callbacks execute
				passed down functions. Example Wait 5 seconds and the function
				with the console.log activates.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Given with enough time to study the anonymous functions. This lab
				wasn't too difficult to understand as.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Results given are that of the JS code working properly with feedback
				, though not properly showing my name in the HTML. JS code has UserName
				functions to make the pop-up message functional. Not much in terms of
				understanding the internal mechanics.</p>

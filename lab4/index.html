	<h1>Lab 4 Psuedocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
	<p>The main challennge of this lab is to be familiar of the process of
		creating a coherent file structure organization as well as knowing how to
		File Transfer via GitHub Desktop from our local computers to our own
		GitHub servers. We test our modified files to see if our changes on
		our webpages by debugging for any errors and check our edits via Google
		for any persisting errors.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>This challenge wasn't hard to accomplish as I've already went over this
	 process on my last semester in CST-251. There were a couple moments of doubt
	 of where I need to put the div tags on my main Homepage, but I only ended
	 up using one pair of tags on my lab navigation.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The File Structure is just like the one I've borrowed from the Wes's
	provided template as instructed. The CSS-less Homepage was given one
	pair of div tags as the navigation links to the labs.</p>

	<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
	<div>
		<p>The main challennge of this lab is getting to know the first steps
		of getting into using Javascript by making an outline of priorities tasks.
		These tasks are like our everyday tasks in real-life except that in
		Javascript it's more described as programming.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<div>
		<p>This lab wasn't too hard to accomplish as it's only jotting down a set
		routine notes about tasks that reflect on what we need to program within
		Javascript itself. I will admit that I was slightly intimidated working on
	  a different kind of web coding for the first time in attempting to understand
		the structure.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The js file within lab4 has both an author block as well as the routine
		tasks that I've made up that's indicated in my HTML. </p>

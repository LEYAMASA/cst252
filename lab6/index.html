		<h1>Lab 6 Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<div>
			<p>The main challennge of this lab is working with composite data types
			of Javascript: Arrays and Objects. Arrays are ordered lists carrying
			data while Objects are a collection of properties and methods.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Overall this lab was a bit tricky to understand of how JS Objects
			work as  I attempted to show myMainRide on Google's Browser Console.
			It turned out that there was a strange issue that the console doesn't
			show myMainRide's properties and it was replaced with [object Object]
			as I don't have any clues as to figure the issue of my object inputs.
			The Arrays on the other hand are fairly easy to get around with the
			Browser Console.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Overall, one unanswered question of how the Browser doesn't quite
			recognize my object properties, but the arrays as well as my js Atom
			file are working in proper order of instructions</p>
		</div>

				 <h2>Script Output</h2>
				 <script src="js/lab.js"></script>

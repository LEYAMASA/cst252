		<h1>Lab 6 Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<div>
			<p>The main challennge of this lab is working with one of the basic data types
			of Javascript. The Primitive Data Types: Strings, Numbers, and Booleans. We are
		 	introduced to using Google Chrome's Console Tab to experiment the usage of Javascript's
	  	application as to how it can make a web page to function.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Overall this lab took a bit of time to understand how Javascript functions work within
			a webpage. It wasn't terribly difficult as this is the basics of Javascript as it is
		  similar to working with a calculator. It was intriguing as to how this can
			connect into the HTML of the webpage.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The Results here has the var variables as said needed to describe my own
			car, a 2015 Nissan Versa. The document writelns in the js source is working
			properly within the HTML webpage that I set up.</p>

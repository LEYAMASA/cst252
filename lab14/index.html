		<h1>Lab 14 Loops</h1>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In this lab, we learned on how to do loop functions within JS code.
				Loops allows the performing of the same tasks over and over again within
				JS coding. We're introduced of two kinds of loops: "For"Loops and
				"While" Loops as the former determines you knowing how many set number
				of times you want to repeat tasks as the latter is for when you don't
				know how many times you need to repeat the task on the code.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This lab challenges us on recreating the FizzBuzzBoom demonstration
				from the lecture. I took some of the lecture's code and added
				$("#output").append command for each string for the numerical expression
				representing FizzBuzzBoom as shown on #output id. The numerical
				represention of each word appears within the list of numbers less than
				or equal to 50 as the words only replace the numbers that are divisible
				by the numerical expressions of the three words FizzBuzzBoom. For the
				most part, this exercise builds upon using For Loops as this was
				interesting to see with the code duplicating tasks as well as
				combined with if else statements with each of the numerical expressions
				words applied onto code. Most definitely a good experience and not a
				bad challenge to overcome.
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>While you won't be able to see the screenshots posted on this
				Lab Webpage within the screenshot, you'll see I successfully made the
				code work as $("#output").append applied onto each numerical word
				expression that now appears based on the divisibility of its numerical
			 	value divided by 50.</p>

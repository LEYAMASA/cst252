			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<button id="problem-button">Change Problem!</button>
			<div id="problem">
				<p>In this lab, we explore more into using jQuery as we learn more
				coding techniques within JS such as modifying classes/ids and input
				elements. It involves of changing CSS properties without the need of JS
			 	commands and keep CSS properties intact as well as using JS to
				respond to the values entered in a form.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<button id="challenge-button">Change Challenge!</button>
			<div id="challenge">
				<p>This lab wasn't too hard to accomplish as the main challenge of
				this lab is to toggle around button elements to react according to the
				styles put into CSS properties. It really emphasizes the changing of
			 	static values into a different property by jQuery itself. This was an
				overall interesting lab experience.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<button id="result-button">Change Result!</button>
			<div id="result">
				<p>Here you see that I've modelled the code after Wes Modes' js
				Fiddle demonstration within his lecture. I've given each of the three
				buttons above their own unique CSS properties and enabled them to
				function as text changers via jQuery commands</p>

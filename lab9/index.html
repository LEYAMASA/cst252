		<h1>Lab 9 JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		<div>
			<p>The main challennge of this lab is working with functions on
			Javascript. Functions are blocks of code used for performing specific
			tasks.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Overall this lab was very difficult in understanding the execution
			of putting in feedback. I wasn't sure of how to properly show the
			function within the HTML and I want to invest some time into this
			particular part of JS programming to better understand the parameters
			as well as any other code pairs.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Results given are that of the JS code working properly with feedback
			, though not properly showing my name in the HTML. JS code has UserName
			functions to make the pop-up message functional. Not much in terms of
			understanding the internal mechanics.</p>

		<h1>Lab 9 Javascript for the Web</h1>
			<div>
				<p>This lab explores into further editing with Javascript onto HTML.
				We use a var element = document.getElementById("element name") to
				interact with the HTML Elements by giving them some CSS dress up via
				Javascript as well as creating new elements and append them to the
				pre-existing element we tied ti the getElementById var. All of This
			 	defines the process of editing DOM (Document Object Model) HTML
				hierarchy.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Overall this lab wasn't too hard to accomplish as it was fun
					toying around my lab HTML via Javascript with CSS command elements.
					It's very interesting that Javascript as the functioning part of web
					development can also change up CSS along with HTML as I am curious
					if Javascript could override CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>I've accomplished setting up my lab web page including two new
				paragraph elements via Javascript and assigned them with two different
				colors, background colors, and font sizes. This was quite a fun lab to
				do.</p>

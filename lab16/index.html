		<h1>Lab 16 JavaScript Classes and Objects</h1>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In this lab, we work with using JavaScript Classes and Objects as we
				learned a plethora of new ways of what to do using JavasScript Objects
				such as loops, deletion, and muting. However, this lab focuses on the
				emphasis on object prototypes as it creates new objects of similar
				type to which they are created via constructors.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This lab was fairly challenging as to properly establish a constructor.
				There was some difficulty as to determine why the constructor wasn't
				working via info() inside of my constructor which is where I thought it
				belonged initially to which being attached to a value by adding onto
				the constructor values. Those assumptions turned to not give Results
				combined with the errors I made in my jQuery output appending process.
				Thankfully I looked back into the lecture recordings and the professor's
			 	webpage for the lab to check for the errors to correct my errors.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Here you see that I was able to show my object prototype via using
				a constructor of using similar object type. It reads:</p>

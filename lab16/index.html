		<h1>Lab 15 Basic Debugging</h1>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In this lab, we learned on how to do basic debugging which is the
				method of finding dysfunctional code functions within our code. there
				are two different kinds of errors that exist within using our browser
				debugging console: syntax and logical errors. The former is when the
				system doesn't understand any manual command inputs and the latter is
				when your code is correct, but doesn't do what you intended to do.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This lab wasn't exactly a challenge, but rather moreso treating as a
					lesson in identifying the definitions of debugging issues of code. I
					reused Lab 13 as a reference point since it was one of the labs I used
					to struggle with. What was interesting is that of not just using the
					browser console to debug for issues, but that of using the Sources
					panel to find my JS file to identify the line that had the error within
					my code.
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Here I show that of finding my code issue in Lab 13 into a Debugging
				example. Look at the debugging section of this Lab page for explanation</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Debugging</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Previously in Lab 13, I've had issues of getting my name input Into
				a wizard house student name, but the debugging tool within my Sources
			 	when entering my name value in the web page reveals that I was missing
		 		a defined value for credits under my text function as the credit value
				was a hyperlink to another website's assets.</p>

		<h1>Lab 17 Object-Oriented Design</h1>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In this lab, we learned about the concept of JavaScript Classes as
				well as Object-Oriented Design (OOP). The former is derived from our
				last lab's focus on object prototypes and the latter is for laying
				out a general approach in programming JavaScript Classes. JS Classes
				are somewhat a better version than of using JS prototypes as they are
				a syntax that supports most modern programming languages. Classes are
				more organized than of using standard prototype structuring. On the other
				hand OOP is an outline of steps to code in JS Classes providing details
				of implementing the JS class code.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This lab was also fairly challenging as much as the last lab as I
				followed along the lecture recording on both JS classes and OOP.
			 	Modifying my previous Lab 16 JS prototype code into classes wasn't
			 	really as much hassle than the last lab's problem of placing the code
				correctly, but I was confounded by the issue of getting my console.log
				reference working. Thankfully I resolved that issue as it was an error
				of being placed as an object part of the class function. The OOP on the
				other hand wasn't as much trouble as it is just an outline of the class
				code.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

				<p>Here you see the modified code over from my Lab 16's object prototype
				code into a JS class code.</p>

		<h1>Lab 13 Conditionals</h1>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In this lab, we continue to use jQuery and learn about Expressions
				and Conditionals of a code program. Expressions are to test with
				booleans to verify something as either true or false and Conditionals
				are programming code that checks under different conditions to activate
				when certain values are typed in response.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This lab combines the challenges of both Expressions And
				Conditionals as the lab assigned to use the mod function to assign
				numerical expressions for each of the four Harry Potter houses as
				well as creating else if statements applied onto each of the four
				houses. These two tied together with both input and button functions
				tied along with the SortingHat variables and a large plethora of text
				for the four houses. This was modelled after Wes's JS Source Code for
				his Conditionals lab page with the provided code, but mostly I had
				to make sure all of the functions listed above are working well along
				with changing the old JS code of document.get to jQuery commands. An
				overall good lab experience to see these new kinds of code.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Here you see that I've modelled the code after Wes Modes' js
				Conditionals Web Page for Lab 13's objectives. It works very well within
				translating normal JS into jQuery commands. Results are shown my name
				goes "Raverin".</p>
